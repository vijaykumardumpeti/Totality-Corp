# Totality Corp Frontend Developer Assignment

Welcome to my submission for the Totality Corp Frontend Developer Assignment. In this README, I'll provide an overview of my approach to the assignment and the tech stack I used.

## Approach

### Project Structure

I organized the project into the following main components:

- **AllProductsSection**: Displayed a variety of products with images, names, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.
- **Cart**: Implemented a cart section to manage added items, quantities, and calculate the total cost.
- **CartItem**: Created individual cart item components for each product in the cart.
- **CartListView**: Designed a list view for the cart to display added items.
- **CartSummary**: Provided a summary of the cart, including the total cost and item count.
- **EmptyCartView**: Presented a view when the cart is empty.
- **FiltersGroup**: Implemented filters to allow users to sort products by category, price range, or ratings.
- **Header**: Created a header component for navigation and user interaction.
- **Home**: The main landing page of the e-commerce website.
- **LoginForm**: Provided a user login form for authentication (optional).
- **NotFound**: Displayed a "Not Found" page for any non-existent routes.
- **PrimeDealsSection**: Highlighted prime deals or special offers.
- **ProductCard**: Designed individual product cards for the product listing.
- **ProductItemDetails**: Displayed detailed information about a specific product.
- **Products**: Managed the product listing and interactions.
- **ProductsHeader**: Created a header for the product listing section.
- **ProtectedRoute**: Implemented protected routes for authenticated users (optional).
- **SimilarProductItem**: Showcased similar products on the product details page.
- **context**: Utilized context for state management.

### Libraries and Frameworks

To build this project, I used the following technologies:

- **React**: Chose React as the frontend library for its component-based architecture and ease of use.
- **Context**: Utilized Context for state management, especially for the shopping cart.
- **React Router**: Implemented client-side routing for a smooth user experience.
- **Fetch**: Used Fetch for making API requests to simulate product data and interactions.

### Responsive Design

Ensuring a responsive design was a priority. I used CSS media queries to adapt the layout for various screen sizes, making the website look and function well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Challenges and Problem-Solving

- For real-time cart updates, I used Context to manage cart state.
- Handling user authentication was a challenge, but I implemented secure login processes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework/Library**: React
- **State Management**: Context
- **Routing**: React Router
- **API Requests**: Fetch
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Media Queries

## Deployment

I deployed the application on Render. You can access the live demo [here](https://your-deployment-link.com/).

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install --exact`.

   **Note:** We use the `--exact` flag to ensure that the exact versions of dependencies specified in `package.json` are installed. This helps maintain consistency in our project's environment, especially when dependencies may change over time.

3. Start the development server with `npm start`.
